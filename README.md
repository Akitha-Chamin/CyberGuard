🛡️ CyberGuard Platform — Installation & Setup Guide

CyberGuard is a full-stack web application built with Node.js (backend) and MySQL (database).
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on a fresh computer. Recommend to download the files and following below steps for full functionality.

1️⃣ Prerequisites

Install the following software before proceeding:

Node.js (LTS version)
👉 https://nodejs.org/

XAMPP (for MySQL Database)
👉 https://www.apachefriends.org/

Visual Studio Code (Optional – recommended for editing)
👉 https://code.visualstudio.com/

✅ After installing Node.js, restart your computer to avoid path issues.

2️⃣ Database Setup (MySQL)

Follow these steps to create the database manually:

Open the XAMPP Control Panel

Click Start next to:

Apache

MySQL

Click Admin next to MySQL
(or open http://localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser)

Create the Database

Click New in the sidebar

Enter:

Database Name: cyberguard

Click Create

Create the Table

Select the cyberguard database

Click the SQL tab

Paste the following SQL and click Go:

CREATE TABLE incidents (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(50),
    date VARCHAR(20),
    time VARCHAR(20),
    system VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT,
    severity VARCHAR(20),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Open',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);


✅ Database setup complete.

3️⃣ Project Installation

Unzip the project folder CyberGuard_App

Move it to your Desktop or any preferred directory

Open the folder

Right-click inside the folder and select:

Open in Terminal / Command Prompt / Git Bash

Run the following command:

npm install


📦 This installs all required dependencies (express, mysql2, etc.) and creates the node_modules folder.

4️⃣ Running the Application

Ensure MySQL is running in XAMPP (green indicator)

In the project folder terminal, run:

node server.js

Expected Output
🚀 Server running at http://localhost:3000
✅ Connected to XAMPP MySQL Database


If you see this — you’re good. No drama.

5️⃣ Viewing the Website

Open your browser and go to:

👉 http://localhost:3000

⚠️ Important:
Do NOT double-click HTML files.
The app must be accessed via the Node.js server.

🛠️ Troubleshooting
❌ Database Connection Failed

Make sure MySQL is running in XAMPP

Confirm database name is exactly: cyberguard

Ensure MySQL port is 3306 (XAMPP default)

❌ 'npm' is not recognized

Node.js is not installed correctly

Reinstall Node.js (LTS)

Restart your computer

❌ Icons missing / slow loading

Ensure you have an active internet connection
(fonts & icons are loaded from external CDNs)

Hard refresh the page: Ctrl + F5

ℹ️ Notes

Initial load may be slightly slow when running on localhost

This is normal for Node.js apps in development mode
